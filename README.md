Note
--------

* Some of you may experience image loading problem using cellular network. This is because of your carrier's default setup for DNS which prevents some sites - such as blogspot.com, which happens to be the most popular image hosting on Manga24h - to be accessed. The solution is to use apps that can change this value, most notable one is [Override DNS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mx17.overridedns).
